        <h1>List of Ethnic Groups in Indonesia and Social Institutions of Its People</h1>
        
        <p>Indonesia consists of about 1,340 ethnic groups spread almost throughout Indonesia. According to BPS data itself half or 50% of the nation's tribe in the country is Javanese. The rest of the tribes that inhabit the territory of Indonesia outside Java such as the Makasar Bugis tribe (3.68%), Batak 2.04%, Bali 1.88%, Aceh 1.4%, and other tribes.
          Each tribe has different customs and norms. However, diversity does not make the nation fragmented, instead diversity then unites to achieve the goal of a just and prosperous society. 

        </p>
        <h1>Understanding the Nation</h1>
        <p>A tribe is a class of people who identify with others based on lineage referring to characteristics such as culture, nation, language, religion and behavior. Ethnic groups are also a social group that is distinguished from other social groups, because it has the most basic and common characteristics related to its origin, place of origin, and culture.
          In another definition, a tribe is also a special social tribe and is asscriptive or has existed since birth, and has the same pattern as the age and gender. The tribes themselves can be grouped based on:
          Mixed tribes, in which there is a mixture between races that inhabit one particular region or region. For example, in the Peranakan tribe which is a mixture between Chinese and Malay races.
          Lineage, as the main factor for the tribe. There are three lineages in Indonesia, namely the paternal lineage (patrilineal), usually in batak, Ambon, Timor and others, maternal lineage (matrilineal), usually occurs in the Minangkabau tribe in South Sumatra and the paternal and maternal lineage that is widely run by Javanese tribes.

            <img src="/more to explore/img/suku jawa.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="...">

            <p>Javanese people using The Javanese language itself have different rules in terms of vocabulary and intonation based on the relationship between the speaker and the interlocutor, known as upload-ungguh. This aspect of language has a strong social influence in Javanese culture, and makes them very aware of their social status in society.
              In Javanese society, the kinship system is based on bilateral lineages (calculated from two sides, mother and father). With this bilateral or parental principle, a Javanese is in touch as extensively as the family on the part of the mother and also the father.
              Relatively solid kinship is usually entwined in the offspring of one ancestor up to the third generation. However, the quality of nuclear family and extended family relationships varies from family to family, depending on the condition of each family.
